# Specification Quality Checklist: Statistics & Leaderboard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.
- Clarification session (2026-06-26) resolved 4 ambiguities: vote count visibility timing, Win Streak/Accuracy scope, tiebreaker rule, and win streak calculation scope.
- The "Friends", "Weekly", and "All-Time" filter tabs from the mockup are noted as assumptions — initial scope focuses on "Global" (current month) per BR20. This is documented in Assumptions rather than as a clarification since BR20 clearly defines the ranking scope.
- Admin dashboard metrics (FR-09 mention) are deliberately scoped out as a separate concern, documented in Assumptions.
