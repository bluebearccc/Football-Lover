## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- Spec derives from SRS UC06 (Manage Matches), UC07 (Manage Prediction Criteria), FR-06, FR-07, FR-13, FR-15, and business rules BR07–BR14, BR23, BR26–BR30.
- api-football.com is referenced as an external data source (not an implementation detail) since it is a business-level integration requirement from the SRS.
